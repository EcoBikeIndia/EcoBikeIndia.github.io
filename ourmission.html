          <p>EcoBike is an electric-bike sharing platform that aims to reduce the environmental impact of transportation by revolutionizing bike sharing in India and making it a prevalent form of transportation over more polluting and inefficient sources of travel. 
          </p>

          <p>The bike sharing concept works by having a fleet of bikes parked in charging/locking stations all across the city. In order to rent one of these bikes, all one has to do is download the app onto their smartphone, create a quick account, and pay for bike use through online paying options such as PayPal, credit card, etc. One can use it for as long as they want to, paying Rs. 15 for every hour of use. When finished using the bike, one can park it at one of the many conveniently located stations and as soon as the bike locks, you are notified that your rental time has ended and that your PayPal account/credit card has been charged the rental fee. 
          </p>

          <p>EcoBike will first be introduced in the populous city of Mumbai, followed by Delhi. These are both cities with grave traffic and parking problems, and EcoBike will lessen the burden of road and rail transport by providing electric-bike sharing as a viable alternative. We will start with 2,000 bikes and 100 charging/locking stations, and aim to expand to a total fleet of 40,000 bikes and 2,000 stations by the fifth year.
